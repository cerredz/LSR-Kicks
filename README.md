# Overiew 🌟 

LSR Kicks is a full-stack real-world shoe selling application that was created as a way to reach a wider customer audience for the instagram shoe-selling account [lsr.kicks](https://www.instagram.com/lsr.kicks/). The application utilized React for the frontend, node.js for the backend, an SQL database to keep track of the signed in users, their purchase history, and contact history, and also Sanity for the shoe inventory (building the website for non-computer science majors, Sanity is essential due to its simplistic ui when adding inventory to the website). On the website customers information and data is secure, and customers can make payments using either their PayPal or Stripe account to buy shoes on the website. When they purchase the shoes that they want, both LSR-Kicks and the customer get a confirmation email to ensure that the user both ordered what they want and filled out their shipping information correctly.
